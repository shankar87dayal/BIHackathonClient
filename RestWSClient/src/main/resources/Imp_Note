1. Proactive
2. Progressive
3. Participative
4. Thinking


Benefits:-

1) Work done apart from routine work.
2) Solution of future predictable issue.
3) More functionality bug can be found/modified. This will decrease work load from QA team to a little extend.
4) May be WAR migrated for oracle change but oracle changes still pending.
5) Error less log, which indicate that application had no issue.
2) These will also enable TA/BA to figure out any issue and get the solution before it may cause any issue to end user.


Drawback:-
1) TIme consuming
2) Some time not relivent.
